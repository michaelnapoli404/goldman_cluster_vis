# GITKEEP: FORCE TRACKING OF ENTIRE SETTINGS DIRECTORY
#
# This file ensures the settings directory and ALL its contents are tracked in Git,
# OVERRIDING any .gitignore rules that would normally exclude CSV files.
#
# The .gitignore file contains "*.csv" which would ignore important settings files,
# but this directory has explicit exceptions:
#   !wave_visualizer/settings/**/*.csv
#   !wave_visualizer/settings/.gitkeep
#
# Critical settings files that MUST be tracked:
# - visualization_settings/wave_definitions.csv (wave configurations)
# - visualization_settings/value_color_mappings.csv (color schemes)
# - cleaning_settings/missing_value_settings.csv (data cleaning decisions)
# - cleaning_settings/value_merging_settings.csv (category merging rules)
# - metadata_output/variable_labels.csv (SPSS variable descriptions)
# - metadata_output/value_labels.csv (SPSS value mappings)
# - processed_data.csv (cleaned dataset)
#
# This ensures the package configuration is always preserved in version control.
